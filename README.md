# Time Series Crime Analysis

This project is to explore the crime incident counts in Boston and model it in time, with
an emphasis on the total crime incident counts and the assault crime counts as an example of
violent crime. The project aims to use models and techniques learned in the time series class to explore possible models and relationships of the dataset.

The final report is in the report pdf file. The used data files are included in the csv files in the directory.
